## OpsPilot v1

AI-powered RegTech platform for derivatives post-trade reconciliation and nightly SPAN/risk parameter summaries.

### Product story
OpsPilot automates reconciliation and risk summarization so operations teams resolve breaks faster and regulators get transparent, reproducible lineage. Post-trade volumes are rising while margins compress; teams need explainable automation now. Buyers are heads of Operations, Risk, and Compliance at brokers, FCMs, and buy-side firms.

### Architecture overview
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router, Tailwind)
- Backend: FastAPI (Python), Pandas for matching/diffs, optional AI summaries
- Storage: Local `/tmp` in dev, S3 in prod; Postgres for app config + audit headers
- Ingestion: CSV/SFTP/API adapters, validation via Pydantic (Pandera optional)
- Reports: Exception CSV/PDF stubs, regulator-friendly mode
 - New features: Predictive reconciliation, Margin Impact, Regulator-ready export, N-way recon, Clustering

See `docs/architecture.md` for diagram and flow details.

### Request/response flows
- Reconciliation
  - Request: Upload internal/cleared files ‚Üí `/upload` ‚Üí `/reconcile`
  - Response: JSON with match stats, exceptions, severity, cluster hints; CSV export via `/reports/exception`
- SPAN/Risk
  - Request: Upload SPAN file ‚Üí `/upload` ‚Üí `/risk/changes`
  - Response: JSON diff vs yesterday + concise narrative summary

### AI usage (human-in-the-loop)
- Summaries and explanations only; never auto-change books/records
- Every AI output is attributable with provenance in Regulator Mode
- Can be disabled via `AI_ENABLED=false` (rule-based fallback)

### Security posture
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS assumed) and designed for encryption at rest (KMS in prod)
- Role-based access control (stubbed) and least-privilege IAM (Terraform stubs)
- Structured audit logs with correlation IDs and hash-chain integrity
- Retention knobs for uploads, processed artifacts, and logs

### Dev quickstart
Requirements: Docker, Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Metrics: http://localhost:8000/metrics

Run DB migration (optional but recommended for audit headers):
```bash
docker compose exec backend bash -lc "alembic upgrade head"
```

Start background worker (optional for async tasks):
```bash
docker compose up -d worker
```

Set envs in `frontend/.env.local` (copy from `.env.local.example`).
